# QA_TASK
-To run REQRES rest apis task you can run each class individually or you can run REQRES.xml

-(Retrieve user api returns 404, i guess something wrong with it)

-To run web task you can run it directly from the class webFrameworkTests.TestAddToCart

-You need intilij and java to be able to run this framework

-You can export reports from intilij after running

-If any problem happens when running web framework, rerun it again and it should work, sometimes there are just cached data
